The idea of this assignment is to take an existing array of names
and then output either Hello 'Name' or Good Bye 'Name' to the console.
The program should say "Hello" to any name except names that start with a "J"
or "j", otherwise, the program should say "Good Bye". So, the final output
on the console should look like this:

Hello Yaakov
Good Bye John
Good Bye Jen
Good Bye Jason
Hello Paul
Hello Frank
Hello Larry
Hello Paula
Hello Laura
Good Bye Jim
